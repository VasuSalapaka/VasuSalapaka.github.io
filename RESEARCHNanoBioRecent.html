	      <div class="card-body"> We are developing a systematic framework for designing the control for fine positioning (scanning) stages of X-ray microscopes is presented. This framework facilitates
designs that simultaneously achieve specifications on positioning resolution and tracking bandwidth while guaranteeing robustness of the closed loop device to unmodeled uncertainties. We use robust optimal control techniques
for modeling, quantifying design objectives and systemspecific challenges, and designing the control laws. The
control designs were implemented on a three degree of freedom piezoactuated flexure stages dedicated for fine
positioning of X-ray optics. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in positioning performance
of 134%, 150%, and 132% in tracking bandwidths along the lateral (X), vertical (Y), and beam (Z) directions, respectively, when compared to proportional–integral–derivative controller designs. This was achieved while keeping similar or better positioning resolution and robustness measures. Fast scanning for X-ray imaging was demonstrated in both the step scan and flyscan modes, where bandwidth was improved by over 450 times with flyscan compared to the
step scan <a  href="pdfs/2020MashrafiMechatronics.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>. In X-ray microscopy it is imperative that the 
relative position between the optics stage, that carries the
X-ray focusing optics, and the sample stage follow a
certain trajectory while either the optics or sample stage
is being scanned. Main challenges in achieving this
requirement include - open loop drift, environmental
disturbance, measurement noise, sensor drift, and control
hardware limit. An unaddressed issue in our existing
robust control design is that the sensors and the fixtures
that hold the sensors drift with time due to changing air
temperature in the APS beamline. Since the drift of sensor
itself is not measured, it affects the relative position
between the focusing optics and sample resulting into
imaging artifacts and reduced image resolution. In this
article, we demonstrate the rejection of the sensor drift by
directly measuring the displacement of the sensor with
respect to the global reference frame. Both the measured
sensor displacement (i.e. sensor drift) and optics stage
displacement are incorporated in the H_inf control
architecture to achieve the above mentioned objectives in
addition to minimal relative displacement between the
optics stage and the sample stage. This will improve the Xray image resolution and reduce image artifacts.

	      <div class="card-body"> We are developing a new method of atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging that exploits the recent rapid advances in  fabrication of piezoactuated positioning mechanisms that are much faster with bandwidth on the order of 30 kHz  (about 50 times faster than the positioning systems in the commercial AFMs). Current state-of-art microscopy is still using techniques such as tapping-mode AFM (or intermittent mode) imaging, which rely on the sensing-probe bandwidth being much higher than positioning bandwidth (the ratio of these bandwidths >150 in current commercial AFMs); while we aim to attain around 50-100 times higher bandwidth by using fast positioning systems (where the same ratio is le 3) <a  href="pdfs/p75.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> .  We are developing new operational modes where imaging is done at much higher speeds by controlling the interaction force directly instead of its derivatives (such as amplitude regulation in tapping mode). This method also allows a design scheme based on modern control theory, which exploits the way the surface properties (stiffness and damping) enter the dynamical model, to obtain a signal that will estimate these properties in real time 
<a  href="pdfs/C_2012d_DSCC_MohanLS.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>. Onr of the major challenges toward this design is that the dynamic relationship between the piezoactuation  and the cantilver deflection is nonlinear, uncertain, and depends on the unknown sample topography. We have developed models that approximate these dynamics  based on rotational frames, which significantly simply the models and analysis <a  href="pdfs/YuchenXu_MS_Thesis"> <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>, and the corresonding control. The models in the rottational frame allows for better linear approximations and enable effective linear control designs <a  href="pdfs/RamSaiGorugantu_thesis_final.pdf"> <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>
