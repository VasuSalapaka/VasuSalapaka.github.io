The CVRPTW is an important problem in allocating resources on networks in time and space.  The algorithm trades off routing and scheduling objectivesin an n-dimensional space using a tunable parameter that allows us to generate qualitatively good solutions. These solutions differ in the degree of intersection of the routes, making the case for transfer points where shipments can be exchanged. Simulation results on randomly generated instances show that the constraints are respected and demonstrate near optimal results (when verifiable) in terms of schedules and tour length of individual tours in each solution. The main feature of our algorithm is its flexibility in accommodating constraints on schedule and extent of  time windows, and capacity constraints on fuel, shipments, and number and size of vehicles.  In this direction we also developed an efficient heuristic framework for approximating the solutions to the multiple traveling salesmen problem (m-TSP) and other variants on the TSP. The approach adopted in this paper is an extension of the Maximum-Entropy-Principle (MEP) and the Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm. The framework is presented as a general tool that can be suitably adapted to a number of variants on the basic TSP. Additionally, unlike most other heuristics for the TSP, the framework presented in this paper is independent of the edges de?ned between any two pairs of nodes.This makes the algorithm particularly suited for variants such as the close-enough traveling salesman problem (CETSP) which are challenging due to added computational complexity. The examples presented in this paper illustrate the effectiveness of this new framework for use in TSP and many variants thereof <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/baranwal2016deterministic.pdf">    <img src= "Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.</div>

	      <div class="card-body">The framework helped developing algorithms for solving combined locational and multihop routing optimization problems. The objective is to determine resource node locations in a multiagent network and to specify the multihop routes from each agent to a common destination through a network of resource nodes that minimize total communication cost. These algorithms accommodate practical constraints on resource nodes as well as on the routing network architectures. Simulation results show that the multihop routes and resource locations allocated by these algorithms achieve lower costs (as low as 47 percent) than those algorithms where resource locational optimization is done without multihop routing or where the locational and routing optimization objectives are separated. The enabling feature of these algorithms is accommodating problems with resource constraints which is demonstrated through simulations  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/p80.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.</div>

	      <div class="card-body">We consider the problem of simplifying large weighted directed graphs by aggregating nodes and edges. This problem is recast as a clustering/resource allocation problem, and a solution method that incorporates features of the deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm is proposed. The novelty in our method is a quantitive measure of dissimilarity that allows us to compare directed graphs of possibly different sizes (i.e., the original and the aggregated graphs).   We further develop a decentralized computational scheme to improve tractability of the algorithm.We developed a pseudo-metric that quantifies how representative an aggregated graph is of the original graph <a  href="pdfs/xu2013distance.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>; We developed computationally efficient algorithms that simplify large weighted directed graphs by aggregating nodes and edges <a  href="pdfs/xu2014aggregation.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>. The graph aggregation algorithm  when extended to Markov chain reduction problem, the aggregated Markov chains capture well the dynamic represented by the original Markov chains. In particular, our work shows that the  norm difference between the aggregated stationary distribution of the original Markov chain and the stationary distribution of the aggregated Markov chain is O(&epsilon;) where &epsilon; measures the mixing between states; In particular we provide explicit bounds on the l_1 norm of the error between the aggregated stationary distribution of the original Markov chain and the stationary distribution of the aggregated Markov chain, which extends on longstanding foundational results (Simon and Ando, 1961) <a  href="pdfs/zC_2014c_CDC_SalapakaXuBS.pdf"> <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>

We adapted this framework also for  the simplification of parametric models describing multiple stochastic processes, by aggregating the processes that have similar input-output behaviors in an ensemble. We propose a clustering-based method, which is general in the sense that the similarity metric upon which the aggregation relies can accommodate processes characterized by a variety of generative models. To illustrate our aggregation framework, we investigated an example system comprised of a set of point process models for earthquakes i<a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/p84.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

	      <div class="card-body">We used our framework to develop a computationally efficient framework to solve a large class of dynamic coverage and clustering problems, ranging from those that arise from deployment of mobile sensor networks to classification of cellular data 
for diagnosing cancer stages. This framework provides the ability to identify natural clusters in the underlying data 
set. In particular, we define the problem of minimizing instantaneous coverage as a combinatorial optimization problem 
in a Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) framework that we formulate specifically for the dynamic setting, and which allows 
us to address inherent tradeoffs such as those between the resolution of the identified clusters and computational cost. The proposed MEP framework addresses both the coverage and the tracking aspects of these problems.
It  enables inclusion of certain dynamic constraints not possible earlier, giving at least 10 times  improvement in computation time over existing algorithms
