	      <div class="card-body">We developed a framework to address a class of sequential decision making problems. Our framework features learning the optimal control policy with robustness to noisy data, determining the unknown state and action parameters, and performing sensitivity analysis with respect to problem parameters. We consider two broad categories of sequential decision making problems modelled as infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with (and without) an absorbing state. The central idea underlying our framework is to quantify exploration in terms of the Shannon Entropy of the trajectories under the MDP and determine the stochastic policy that maximizes it while guaranteeing a low value of the expected cost along a trajectory. This resulting policy enhances the quality of exploration early on in the learning process, and consequently allows faster convergence rates and robust solutions even in the presence of noisy data as demonstrated in our comparisons to popular algorithms such as Q-learning, Double Q-learning and entropy regularized Soft Q-learning. The framework extends to the class of parameterized MDP and RL problems, where states and actions are parameter dependent, and the objective is to determine the optimal parameters along with the corresponding optimal policy. Here, the associated cost function can possibly be non-convex with multiple poor local minima. Simulation results applied to a 5G small cell network problem demonstrate successful determination of communication routes and the small cell locations. We also obtain sensitivity measures to problem parameters and robustness to noisy environment data.</div>

	      <div class="card-body">A viable approach in the study of discrete time Markov chains with large state spaces is to determine a smaller representative Markov chain with far lesser number of states such that, it approximates the original stochastic model. Typically, the number of super-states in the aggregated Markov chain is pre-specified based on prior knowledge, computational limitations or bounds on the dissimilarity measure (such as KL-divergence) between the two stochastic models. In this paper, we establish and quantify a notion of {\em persistence} of an aggregated Markov chain that enables comparison of the aggregated models with different number of super-states. As a consequence, the aggregated model with the largest persistence specifies the {\em natural} (or true) number of super-states for the original Markov chain. The idea of persistence is related to the average number of bits (or, the memory size), measured in terms of the cross entropy, required to represent the original Markov chain using the aggregated stochastic model. We provide simulations that demonstrate the efficacy of persistence in comparing the aggregated models with distinct number of super-states, as well as in ascertaining the natural number of super-states in the aggregated representation of the original Markov chains.</div>
