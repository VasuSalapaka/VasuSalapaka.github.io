CLASSIFICATION, AND AGGREGATION OF LARGE DATA SETS, </span> 
	where we are developing frameworks for designing algorithms to efficiently solve the underlying combinatorial optimization problems. 
Rapid development in geopositioning information systems, cheap sensors, processing capability, and lower form factors has facilitated cheap and abundant information/data that can be exploited in a variety of applications such as wireless sensing networks, intelligent building systems, wireless communication, social networks and advertising, transportation, computer networking, facility allocation, bio/chemo informatics, combinatorial drug/material discovery, and battlefield management. Data analysis and aggregation, and resource allocation objectives in these applications pose similar optimization problems. The common feature to these problems is the need for partitioning a large set of elements into groups containing similar elements. The associated computational expense is combinatorial, that is, it scales with the number of combinations of the constituent elements. Related optimization problems have non convex cost functions that are riddled with multiple local minima, and are proved to be computationally complex (NP-hard). My group is developing a comprehensive framework where we address the combinatorial computational complexity, variability in associated clustering or coverage cost functions, area-specific constraints on the network structure, communication, and dynamics of constituent elements and their interactions or interdependencies. The central idea of our framework is based on maximum entropy principle (MEP) from statistics and minimum free energy principle from thermodynamics (it mimics statistical mechanical solutions to similar combinatorial problems that occur in nature). Here, a probability density function (pdf) is ascribed on the space of decision variables, in such a way that the most probable value for the decision variable is a solution to an approximation of the combinatorial problem under the given constraints. The decision variables are then iteratively computed, where with each successive iteration, the approximation error is made smaller. We determine the Gibbs pdf by using the MEP, that is, by finding the distribution which maximizes the Shannon entropy. We have exploited the versatility of this framework in designing appropriate pdfs by incorporating problem-specific constraints in the MEP formulation.

	where we  aim  comprehensive technology for developing and implementing smart-grid technologies capable of harnessing much more power from renewable (though) uncertain power sources while guaranteeing grid stability and satisfying economic power sharing constraints.  It is realized that there can be enormous benefits in design and analysis of existing and emerging power grid technologies if there is a joint effort from controls and power communities. My research aims at design, implementation, and analysis of a power-electronics based grid that enables distributed generation, prioritization, and integration of heterogeneous power sources; while incorporating objectives related to economics and reliability. This work aims a flexible control architecture that applies to the existing top-down grid as well as grids with smart distributed energy sources and loads. We have applied modern systems techniques for developing control of power-grid/ power electronics technologies, and has played a central role in designing, developing, and testing new systems.

Motor proteins such
as kinesin and dynein are critical components of intracellular transport. Their
study is important to understand cellular functionality, where malfunction in
their transport may cause neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This
study aims at gaining insights on the intracellular transport of motor proteins
(such as Kinesin and Dynein) on a microtubular track,
and on the role of feedback control on their transport (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJyUtbn0O5Y">this</a> video to know
about these molecules). We want to achieve this by combining our (along with my
collaborators’) instrumentation skills. We are developing models for this
transport that we will identify and validate using experimental setup.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Our model for describing the motor-protein
walk comprises a feedback stochastic model, which switches between two
stochastic differential systems, where the switching criteria is a
state-dependent stochastic variable. Simulations demonstrate that the feedback
mechanism helps achieve an increased average velocity of transport and
corroborates the hypothesis that a motor protein can achieve higher speeds of
transport by restricting or enabling attachment/detachment of ATP/ADP like
molecules depending on conformational changes in the motor-protein <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p83.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.  Inspired by this biological transport mechsnism, we are developing systems for  engineered transport of material at the nano/micro scale  for the manufacturing platforms of
the future. Unlike conventional transport systems, at the nano/micro scale, transport has to be achieved
in the presence of fundamental sources of uncertainty such as thermal noise. Remarkably, it is possible
to extract useful work by rectifying noise using an asymmetric potential; a principle used by Brownian
ratchets. In this direction a systematic methodology for designing open-loop Brownian ratchet mechanisms
that optimize velocity and efficiency is developed. We show that methods that strive
to optimize velocity of transport may compromise efficiency. A dynamic programming based approach
is presented which yields up to three times improvement in efficiency over optimized open loop designs
and 35% better efficiency over reported closed loop strategies that focus on optimizing velocities <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/roychowdhury2015control.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt="FNF" width:auto height="20" border="0">  </a>

Optical traps provide an efficient way of probing
the motor proteins via bead handles as they enable nm spatial resolution and femto-Newton force resolution capabilities (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13VXGX2yR3k">this video</a> to know more about optical traps).  A main challenge in investigation of optical tweezer based studies of
motor-proteins stems from  thermal noise and the
nonlinear dynamics of the system. Our initial effort, where we used optical
tweezers for load force regulation on processive
motors yielded significant insights into intracellular transport mechanisms as
well as removed certain prevalent perceived limitations in the corresponding
instrumentation. Our methodology
circumvents the limitations of existing active force clamps (optical clamps
that hold the protein head fixed with respect to its body) by using
experimentally determined models for various components of the optical tweezer
system, thus enabling probing motor proteins at higher speeds. This paradigm
also allows for real-time step estimation for step sizes as small as 8 nm with
dwell time of 5 ms without sacrificing
force regulation. This approach enabled exploration of spatial and temporal
realms of motor protein investigation which were not possible earlier <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/roychowdhury2013high.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.<span

 The ability to control and manipulate matter at atomic scales wields a massive potential - especially in areas of biology, material science and physics. Its impact is already evident from the remarkable feats achieved in the last three decades toward probing and manipulating matter at atomic scales. The potential of this technology is evident from its proposed use in bioassays, drug discovery, quantum computing, and tailoring material with atomic scale specificity. My research aims at integrating nanodynamical concepts, systems tools, and device design to enable and perform high-resolution, high-bandwidth, and reliable positioning and imaging for nanoscientific studies.

<div class="comment more" style="margin-top:0px">
 High-precision high-speed positioning is critical for most nanoscale investigations. The importance of positioning becomes even more severe since it forms the bottleneck for bandwidth in most nanoscale studies. My research group has developed a system theoretic framework to model, evaluate and control nano-positioning devices and quantify performance objectives and their limitations. We have characterized fundamental trade-offs between positioning resolution, tracking bandwidth, and robustness to modeling uncertainties.  In this framework, feasible performance specifications are posed as optimal control problems, which are solved and the resulting control laws implemented. This approach demonstrates that modern control techniques are necessary (i) to methodically manage modeling-approximation errors and noisy measurements to yield better resolution; (ii) to quantify, specify and design for the crucial, yet often ignored, requirement of reliability (or repeatability of experiments) in terms of metrics on robustness; and (iii) to simultaneously design for performance specifications on resolution, bandwidth, and repeatability. See below for some of our results that showcases 
the impact of this framework.

We attained subnanometer resolution using our framework, where the design appropriately traded bandwidth for resolution.

In this work we improved better performance of precision positioining systems through co-design, that is designing the device  with control design in mind. Along with our collaborators experts on stage designs, we observed that most positioning stages use a separate mass for each independent direction of motion so as to keep the motion decoupled from each other. Such a strategy leads to increased mass, and therefore to reduced resonant frequencies causing smaller bandwidth. By delegating the decoupling of axial-motions on the control design, we demonstrated single-mass positioning systems that achieve significantly higher bandwidths for similar resolution guaranteed by multiple-mass devices  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/Dong2008-Robust.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

Most studies and applications in nanoscience require images of sample topography with nanoscale resolution, which has become possible with microcantilever based probes such as AFMs that are sensitive enough to feel forces as small as inter atomic interactions. Existing methodologies that produce the topography signals are limited by scanner bandwidth; they give images that are faithful to the actual sample topographies only when the scans are slow.

In atomic force  microscopy,  the control signal used for amplitude/deflection regulation is
typically used as the estimate for the sample topography. Therefore, the sample profile estimation
signal is accurate as long as the control signal achieves good amplitude regulation. Earlier it was perceived that the imaging bandwidth cannot be larger than the closed-loop system control bandwidth. However this ignored the  topography information in the regulation error signal at high frequencies.  
In our design scheme, we exploy this information;  the limitations of maintaining a constant
amplitude while scanning at high bandwidth does not impose limitations on the reconstruction
of the sample topography. In fact, we analytically prove that the sample-profile signal
estimation problem can be solved independently of the control design scheme for amplitude
regulation. Therefore, accurate sample-profile estimations can be obtained even at
frequencies near and beyond the closed-loop control bandwidths. This method enables accurate sample-profile imaging even at high scanning speeds where existing methods fail. Experimental results show a 500%  improvement in contact-mode <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/Salapaka2005-Sample.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> and over 70% improvement in dynamic mode in imaging bandwidth  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p67.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> over the pre-existing approaches.

One of the important factors that is often overlooked in AFM is validation of interpreted images - that is whether a feature in the interpreted image is actually present on the sample or if it is a misinterpretation/misrepresentation originating from spurious data. We developed a methodology that achieved simultaneous correction, in real time, for the imaging artifacts caused by cantilever and photosensor misalignments as well as misinterpretations in relative lateral position of the cantilever tip with respect to the sample due to the tip-sample stick in AFM. Experimental results show significant improvement, and in some cases, practical elimination of the artifacts <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/salapaka2013afm.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>

We are developing a new method of atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging that exploits the recent rapid advances in  fabrication of piezoactuated positioning mechanisms that are much faster with bandwidth on the order of 30 kHz  (about 50 times faster than the positioning systems in the commercial AFMs). Current state-of-art microscopy is still using techniques such as tapping-mode AFM (or intermittent mode) imaging, which rely on the sensing-probe bandwidth being much higher than positioning bandwidth (the ratio of these bandwidths >150 in current commercial AFMs); while we aim to attain around 50-100 times higher bandwidth by using fast positioning systems (where the same ratio < 3) <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p75.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> .  We are developing new operational modes where imaging is done at much higher speeds by controlling the interaction force directly instead of its derivatives (such as amplitude regulation in tapping mode). This method also allows a design scheme based on modern control theory, which exploits the way the surface properties (stiffness and damping) enter the dynamical model, to obtain a signal that will estimate these properties in real time

In this work we used our framework to develop an algorithm for the design of lead generation libraries required in combinatorial
drug discovery. This algorithm addresses simultaneously the two key criteria of diversity and representativeness
of compounds in the resulting library and is computationally efficient when applied to a large class of lead
generation design problems. At the same time, additional constraints on experimental resources are also
incorporated in the framework presented in this paper. A computationally efficient scalable algorithm is
developed, where the ability of the deterministic annealing algorithm to identify clusters is exploited to
truncate computations over the entire data set to computations over individual clusters. An analysis of this
algorithm quantifies the tradeoff between the error due to truncation and computational effort. Results applied
on test data sets corroborate the analysis and show improvement by factors as large as 10 or more, depending
on the data sets <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/Sharma2008-Scalable.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.  </div>

We used our framework to develop a computationally efficient framework to solve a large class of dynamic coverage and clustering 
problems, ranging from those that arise from deployment of mobile sensor networks to classification of cellular data 
for diagnosing cancer stages. This framework provides the ability to identify natural clusters in the underlying data 
set. In particular, we define the problem of minimizing instantaneous coverage as a combinatorial optimization problem 
in a Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) framework that we formulate specifically for the dynamic setting, and which allows 
us to address inherent tradeoffs such as those between the resolution of the identified clusters and computational cost. 
The proposed MEP framework addresses both the coverage and the tracking aspects of these problems.
It  enables inclusion of certain dynamic constraints not possible earlier, giving at least 10 times  improvement in computation time over existing algorithms <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p76.pdf">    <img src="pictures/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>

This framework helped developing algorithms for solving combined locational and multihop routing optimization problems. The objective is to determine resource node locations in a multiagent network and to specify the multihop routes from each agent to a common destination through a network of resource nodes that minimize total communication cost. These algorithms accommodate practical constraints on resource nodes as well as on the routing network architectures. Simulation results show that the multihop routes and resource locations allocated by these algorithms achieve lower costs (as low as 47 percent) than those algorithms where resource locational optimization is done without multihop routing or where the locational and routing optimization objectives are separated. The enabling feature of these algorithms is accommodating problems with resource constraints which is demonstrated through simulations  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p80.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

This framework was also extended to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time-Windows (CVRPTW); these applications require routing and scheduling of multiple vehicles from a depot (or multiple depots) to meet demands at multiple locations, under some time-window <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/baranwal2016vehicle.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/parekh2015deterministic.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> and capacity constraints. The CVRPTW is an important problem in allocating resources on networks in time and space.  This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a DA approach has been used for problems in the class of the CVRPTW.  The algorithm trades off routing and scheduling in an n-dimensional space using a tunable parameter that allows us to generate qualitatively good solutions. These solutions differ in the degree of intersection of the routes, making the case for transfer points where shipments can be exchanged. Simulation results on randomly generated instances show that the constraints are respected and demonstrate near optimal results (when verifiable) in terms of schedules and tour length of individual tours in each solution. The main feature of our algorithm is its flexibility in accommodating constraints on schedule and extent of  time windows, and capacity constraints on fuel, shipments, and number and size of vehicles.  In this direction we also developed an efficient heuristic framework for approximating the solutions to the multiple traveling salesmen problem (m-TSP) and other variants on the TSP. The approach adopted in this paper is an extension of the Maximum-Entropy-Principle (MEP) and the Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm. The framework is presented as a general tool that can be suitably adapted to a number of variants on the basic TSP. Additionally, unlike most other heuristics for the TSP, the framework presented in this paper is independent of the edges de?ned between any two pairs of nodes.This makes the algorithm particularly suited for variants such as the close-enough traveling salesman problem (CETSP) which are challenging due to added computational complexity. The examples presented in this paper illustrate the effectiveness of this new framework for use in TSP and many variants thereof <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/baranwal2016deterministic.pdf">    <img src= "pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

We consider the problem of simplifying large weighted directed graphs by aggregating nodes and edges. This problem is recast as a clustering/resource allocation problem, and a solution method that incorporates features of the deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm is proposed. The novelty in our method is a quantitive measure of dissimilarity that allows us to compare directed graphs of possibly different sizes (i.e., the original and the aggregated graphs).   We further develop a decentralized computational scheme to improve tractability of the algorithm.We developed a pseudo-metric that quantifies how representative an aggregated graph is of the original graph <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/xu2013distance.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>; We developed computationally efficient algorithms that simplify large weighted directed graphs by aggregating nodes and edges <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/xu2014aggregation.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

The graph aggregation algorithm  when extended to Markov chain reduction problem, the aggregated Markov chains capture well the dynamic represented by the original Markov chains. In particular, our work shows that the  norm difference between the aggregated stationary distribution of the original Markov chain and the stationary distribution of the aggregated Markov chain is O(&epsilon;) where &epsilon; measures the mixing between states; In particular we provide explicit bounds on
the l_1 norm of the error between the aggregated stationary
distribution of the original Markov chain and the stationary
distribution of the aggregated Markov chain, which extends on
longstanding foundational results (Simon and Ando, 1961).

Analysis, prediction and control of parametric generative models for stochastic processes arise in numerous applications, such as in biology, telecommunications, geography, seismology and finance. In many of these applications, it is desirable to obtain an aggregated behavior from an underlying network of stochastic interactions. This work focuses on the simplification of parametric models describing multiple stochastic processes, by aggregating the processes that have similar input-output behaviors in an ensemble. We propose a clustering-based method, which is general in the sense that the similarity metric upon which the aggregation relies can accommodate processes characterized by a variety of generative models. To illustrate our aggregation framework, we investigated an example system comprised of a set of point process models for earthquakes <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/p84.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference. Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters are kept small. We show that that there are no reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage, current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/salapaka2014viability.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.
We also  demonstrated that the solution to the optimal voltage regulation control problem exhibits an inner-outer cascaded controller
structure even though there are no explicit objectives on tracking current which are targeted. Furthermore, the outerloop voltage control and inner-loop current control structure is insensitive to the weighting transfer functions used in the optimal control problem. Although the inner-outer structure has been used in prior works, the optimal nature of such a structure was not known <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/MTNS16_0200_FI.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

we have developed a comprehensive framework for controlling power electronics (converters and inverters) for managing electrical viability and power sharing between different sources that guarantee performance under uncertainties in load demands and schedules. This architecture also incorporates communication between controllers (at different sources) which gives a graceful degradation of performance with loss in communication network; We have developed an optimal control based distributed design methodology that gives provable  robust power sharing between different sources and voltage regulation performance  at the grid while still avoiding analytical complexities due to distributed structure [e256,e259];
 One of the most important challenges facing an electric grid is to incorporate renewables and distributed energy resources (DERs) to the grid. Because of the associated uncertainties in power generations and peak power demands, opportunities for improving the functioning and reliability of the grid lie in the design of an efficient, yet pragmatic distributed control framework with guaranteed robustness margins. This work addresses the problem of output voltage regulation for multiple DC-DC converters connected to a grid, and prescribes a robust scheme for sharing power among different sources. More precisely, we develop a control architecture where, unlike most standard control frameworks, the desired power ratios appear as reference signals to individual converter systems, and not as internal parameters of the system of parallel converters. This makes the proposed approach suited for scenarios when the desired power ratios vary rapidly with time. Additionally, the proposed control framework is suitable to both centralized and decentralized implementations, i.e., the same control architecture can be employed for voltage regulation irrespective of the availability of common load-current (or power) measurement, without the need to modify controller parameters. The control design is obtained using robust optimal-control framework. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/baranwal2016robust1.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a> .

 We have developed a method to analyze and cluster an electrical power network with many buses into pre-specified number of groups such that buses within each group have a similar influence over the remainder of the network. We developed a practical notion to quantify influence in terms of sensitivity of voltages at each bus to reactive power perturbations at other buses; this notion encompasses electrical connectivity rather than only the network topology.  Furthermore, the grouping of buses achieved is such that the voltage fluctuations at a bus due to perturbations at buses within the same group are  more than voltage fluctuations due to perturbations at buses from other groups  (as demonstrated on  IEEE-14, IEEE 30, and IEEE 300 bus power networks) <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/2016MTNS.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.

Unlike the conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage. Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the viability of the
entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage. The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of system dynamics. In this article
we provide a methodology to determine current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe operation of microgrid. In this work We employed a machine learning approach to address the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data for assessing and guiding our approach. <a style="text-decoration:none" href="pdfs/pdfs/wytock2014preventing.pdf">    <img src="pic/pdfimage.bmp" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.
