	      <div class="card-body">Motor proteins such
as kinesin and dynein are critical components of intracellular transport. Their
study is important to understand cellular functionality, where malfunction in
their transport may cause neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This
study aims at gaining insights on the intracellular transport of motor proteins
(such as Kinesin and Dynein) on a microtubular track,
and on the role of feedback control on their transport (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJyUtbn0O5Y">this</a> video to know
about these molecules). We want to achieve this by combining our (along with my
collaborators’) instrumentation skills. We are developing models for this
transport that we will identify and validate using experimental setup.Our model for describing the motor-protein
walk comprises a feedback stochastic model, which switches between two
stochastic differential systems, where the switching criteria is a
state-dependent stochastic variable. Simulations demonstrate that the feedback
mechanism helps achieve an increased average velocity of transport and
corroborates the hypothesis that a motor protein can achieve higher speeds of
transport by restricting or enabling attachment/detachment of ATP/ADP like
molecules depending on conformational changes in the motor-protein 
<a  href="pdfs/p83.pdf">    <img src="images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.  Inspired by this biological transport mechsnism, we are developing systems for  engineered transport of material at the nano/micro scale  for the manufacturing platforms of
the future. Unlike conventional transport systems, at the nano/micro scale, transport has to be achieved
in the presence of fundamental sources of uncertainty such as thermal noise. Remarkably, it is possible
to extract useful work by rectifying noise using an asymmetric potential; a principle used by Brownian
ratchets. In this direction a systematic methodology for designing open-loop Brownian ratchet mechanisms
that optimize velocity and efficiency is developed. We show that methods that strive
to optimize velocity of transport may compromise efficiency. A dynamic programming based approach
is presented which yields up to three times improvement in efficiency over optimized open loop designs
and 35% better efficiency over reported closed loop strategies that focus on optimizing velocities

the motor proteins via bead handles as they enable nm spatial resolution and femto-Newton force resolution capabilities (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13VXGX2yR3k">this video</a> to know more about optical traps).  A main challenge in investigation of optical tweezer based studies of
motor-proteins stems from  thermal noise and the
nonlinear dynamics of the system. Our initial effort, where we used optical
tweezers for load force regulation on processive
motors yielded significant insights into intracellular transport mechanisms as
well as removed certain prevalent perceived limitations in the corresponding
instrumentation. Our methodology
circumvents the limitations of existing active force clamps (optical clamps
that hold the protein head fixed with respect to its body) by using
experimentally determined models for various components of the optical tweezer
system, thus enabling probing motor proteins at higher speeds. This paradigm
also allows for real-time step estimation for step sizes as small as 8 nm with
dwell time of 5 ms without sacrificing
force regulation. This approach enabled exploration of spatial and temporal
realms of motor protein investigation which were not possible earlier

Along with our collaborators experts on stage designs, we observed that most positioning stages use a separate mass for each independent direction of motion so as to keep the motion decoupled from each other. Such a strategy leads to increased mass, and therefore to reduced resonant frequencies causing smaller bandwidth. By delegating the decoupling of axial-motions on the control design, we demonstrated single-mass positioning systems that achieve significantly higher bandwidths for similar resolution guaranteed by multiple-mass devices  <a   href="pdfs/Dong2008-Robust.pdf">    <img src="Images/pdf.jpg" alt=" " width:auto height="20" border="0"> </a>.
